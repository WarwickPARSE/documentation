\section{Volume Estimation}
\label{volume estimation}
The development of Volume Estimation was split up into two phase of differing accuracy.
\subsection{Minimum Bounding Box}
\label{testing: minimum bounding box}
This section details the testing of the minimum bounding box approach, discussed in Section \ref{design: an initial upper bound approximation}
\subsection{Volume Rendering}
\label{testing: volume rendering}
This section details the testing of the volume rendering approach, discussed in Section \ref{design: a refined approach}
