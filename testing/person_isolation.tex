\section{Person Isolation}
\label{testing:person isolation}
Figure \ref{fig:depth based cut off} shows the depth based cut off, described in Section \ref{design:person isolation}. As predicted, this cut off is sufficient to eliminate a large proportion of non-person data but does not remove the ring of points at the same depth as the person.\\

Figure \ref{fig:depth and hand based cut off} shows the depth and hand based cut off, described in Section \ref{design:person isolation}. As predicted, the combination of these using depth and hand position is sufficient to isolate a person. To aid in the creation of a point cloud, the isolated person is coloured from black to white as depth increases away from the camera.\\
