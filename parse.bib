  abstract = {{D}ensity-based modeling of visual features is very commonin computer
	vision, either by using non-parametric techniques or through representing
	the underlying density function as a weighted sum of {G}aussians.
	{A} number of real-time tasks such as background modeling or modeling
	the appearance of a moving target require sequential density estimation,
	where new data is incorporated in the model as it becomes avail-
	able. {N}evertheless, current methods for updating the den- sity
	function either lack flexibility, by fixing the number of {G}aussians
	in the mixture, or require large memory amounts, by maintaining a
	non-parametric representation of the den- sity. {T}his paper presents
	an efficient method for recursive density approximation that relies
	on the propagation of the density modes. {A}t each time step, the
	modes of the density are re-estimated and a {G}aussian component
	is assigned to each mode. {T}he covariance of each component is derived
	from the {H}essian matrix estimated at the mode location. {T}o detect
	the modes we employ the variable-bandwidth mean shift. {W}hile the
	proposed density representation is mem- ory efficient (which is typical
	for mixture densities), it in- herits the flexibility of non-parametric
	methods, by allow- ing the number of modes to adapt in time. {W}e
	show that the same mode propagation principle applies for subspaces
	derived from eigen analysis. {E}xtensive experimental back- ground
	modeling results demonstrate the performance of the method.}

	clouds which makes very few assumptions: we avoid any manual rough
	alignment or the use of landmarks, displacement can be arbitrarily
	large, and the two point sets can have very little overlap. {C}rude
	alignment is achieved by estimation of the 3{D}-rotation from two
	{E}xtended {G}aussian {I}mages even when the data sets inducing them
	have partial overlap. {T}he technique is based on the correlation
	of the two {EGI}s in the {F}ourier domain and makes use of the spherical
	and rotational harmonic transforms. {F}or pairs with low overlap
	which fail a critical verification step, the rotational alignment
	can be obtained by the alignment of constellation images generated
	from the {EGI}s. {R}otationally aligned sets are matched by correlation
	using the {F}ourier transform of volumetric functions. {A} fine alignment
	is acquired in the final step by running {I}terative {C}losest {P}oints

	The Gaussian, distributions of the adaptive mixture model are then
	evaluated to determine which are most likely to result from a background
	process. Each pixel is classified based on whether the Gaussian distribution
	which represents it most effectively is considered part of the background
	model. This results in a stable, real-time outdoor tracker which
	reliably deals with lighting changes, repetitive motions from clutter,
	and long-term scene changes. This system has been run almost continuously
