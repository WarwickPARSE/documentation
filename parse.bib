  booktitle = {IN CVPR ’06: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2006 IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY CONFERENCE

  year = {2006},
  pages = {1297-1304},
  abstract = {{W}e propose a novel technique for the registration of 3{D} point
	clouds which makes very few assumptions: we avoid any manual rough
	alignment or the use of landmarks, displacement can be arbitrarily
	large, and the two point sets can have very little overlap. {C}rude
	alignment is achieved by estimation of the 3{D}-rotation from two
	{E}xtended {G}aussian {I}mages even when the data sets inducing them
	have partial overlap. {T}he technique is based on the correlation
	of the two {EGI}s in the {F}ourier domain and makes use of the spherical
	and rotational harmonic transforms. {F}or pairs with low overlap
	which fail a critical verification step, the rotational alignment
	can be obtained by the alignment of constellation images generated
	from the {EGI}s. {R}otationally aligned sets are matched by correlation
	using the {F}ourier transform of volumetric functions. {A} fine alignment
	is acquired in the final step by running {I}terative {C}losest {P}oints
	with just few iterations.},
