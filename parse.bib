  abstract = {We propose a novel technique for the registration of 3D point clouds
	which makes very few assumptions: we avoid any manual rough alignment
	or the use of landmarks, displacement can be arbitrarily large, and
	the two point sets can have very little overlap. Crude alignment
	is achieved by estimation of the 3D-rotation from two Extended Gaussian
	Images even when the data sets inducing them have partial overlap.
	The technique is based on the correlation of the two EGIs in the
	Fourier domain and makes use of the spherical and rotational harmonic
	transforms. For pairs with low overlap which fail a critical verification
	step, the rotational alignment can be obtained by the alignment of
	constellation images generated from the EGIs. Rotationally aligned
	sets are matched by correlation using the Fourier transform of volumetric
	functions. A fine alignment is acquired in the final step by running
	Iterative Closest Points with just few iterations.},
