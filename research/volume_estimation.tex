\section{Volume Estimation}
\label{design:volume estimation}
There are many techniques for estimate the volume of an arbitrary 3 dimensional shape. 

LIDAR has previously been used to estimate the height of trees from above \cite{Maltamo2006}.

Three laser scanning-based methods were used

compared were (1) a direct prediction model for the stem volume at plot level, (2) a volume
prediction system based on the modelled percentiles of the basal area diameter distribution, and (3) a
parameter prediction method used to determinate Weibull-based basal area diameter distributions
for the plot-level stem volume prediction.
