\section{The Group}
The group formed out of the desire to work together based on varying levels of previous experience working together, rather than out of a desire to work on a specific project as was the case with other groups.
The group quickly decided to take advantage of the new iLab at Warwick University and chose to make use of the Microsoft Kinect.
Initial ideas revolved around object modelling and sharing, but due to the low resolution of the Kinect, these early ideas were abandoned.
After discussions with the project supervisor, the group chose to tackle the problem proposed by \todo{the italians}.\\

In order to maintain a high group morale, many "memes" were created out of the group to lift spirits and keep humour present after particularly tense group meetings. A selection is reproduced in Figures \ref{fig:we're meeting now?} through to \ref{fig:sexy sexton}
