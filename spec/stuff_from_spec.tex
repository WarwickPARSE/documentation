\section{Problem Statement}
\label{spec: problem statement}
Computer Vision and object recognition are becoming more prevalent in day-to-day life, entering the home through commodity hardware such as the Microsoft Kinect. Because of this, many fields are looking to use the Kinect to automate or improve many of their processes. One such field is medicine, where medical imaging, specifically range imaging is rapidly developing in a number of different contexts, such as patient setup, and being applied in a variety of situations. Advancements in this area are leading to better patient monitoring, diagnosis and treatment of patients in various sub domains in Medicine.\\  

The PARSE project aims to create an application toolkit to increase the reliability and accuracy of the measurements taken when monitoring weight loss and body size variations of a patient. The toolkit will provide an easy to use interface allowing for medical personnel to take measurements of body volume, limb circumferences and relative positions of ultrasound scanners on the surface of the body. These measurements can be stored persistently and be recalled later as part of a patientâ€™s medical record. The remit for achieving this will be in our use of commodity hardware - specifically the Microsoft Kinect.\\
