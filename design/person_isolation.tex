\section{Person Isolation}
\label{person isolation}
This section details the creation of a method to isolate a person from the background data. An advantage of using a Kinect over another camera is that the Kinect is able to isolate a skeleton associated with a person. This skeleton meant that the group did not have to make use of computationally heavy computer vision algorithms to isolate a person \todo{example}.\\

Instead, the method developed used the skeleton to determine the approximate depth of the person (using the HipCenter joint).

to determine the left and right most point of the person (i.e. the persons hands) and exclude everything that was outside this range.
